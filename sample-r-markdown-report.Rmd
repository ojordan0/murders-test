## Other output formats are: pdf_document, word_document, github_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# use a descriptive name for each chunk for debugging purpose
```{r pressure-summary}
summary(pressure)
```

## Ctrl + alt + i keybinding to add the r code chunk block  
# When echo=FALSE, code will be hided in output file

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Example of inline code

 
 ```{r, echo=F}
n <- nrow(mtcars)
```
Here `r n` cars are compared

## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state).

We are going to use the following library:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
  
and load the data we already wrangled:

```{r}
load("rdas/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rate by state 

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  coord_flip()
```
